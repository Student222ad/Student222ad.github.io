## *Introduction to Football*

Football is a game in which two teams of eleven players attempt to move the ball into the goal of the other team by utilizing any part of their body other than their hands and arms. The goalie is the only one allowed to handle the ball, and even then, only in the penalty area that surrounds the goal. Whichever team scores the most goals wins.

Football is the most popular ball game in the world in terms of both participants and spectators. The sport, which has simple rules and equipment, may be played practically anyplace, from official football playing fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), football's governing body, estimated that at the turn of the twenty-first century, there were approximately 250 million football players and over 1.3 billion people "interested" in football; in 2010, a combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched football's premier tournament, the quadrennial month-long World Cup finals.

## History of Football
The History of Football originated in 19th century in England, where organized varieties of the game began to take form in English public schools. The modern versions of American football and soccer have their origins in these early forms of football. American football resulted from major divergences from association football and rugby football, with significant rule changes instituted by Walter Camp, who is considered the "Father of American Football." The first intercollegiate football game was played in 1869 between Princeton and Rutgers, and the further transformation of English rugby into American football came chiefly through the efforts of Walter Camp. Meanwhile, modern football, or soccer, originated in Britain in the 19th century, with the formation of the first Football Association in 1863 and the standardization of rules. The game has a long history, with early forms of team games involving a ball dating back to old Mesoamerican cultures over 3,000 years ago

## How to play Football
The objective of this game is to score the ball into your opponent’s goal. The whole ball needs to be over the line for it to be a legitimate goal. A goal can be scored with any part of the body apart from the hand or arm up to the shoulder. The goal itself consists of a frame measuring 8 feet high and 8 yards wide. 
To win the game, You must score more goals than your opponents. Except in cup games, where the game can go to extra time and even a penalty shootout to determine the victor, if the scores remain level after 90 minutes, the game will conclude in a draw. Except for goalkeepers, who can use any part of their body within the 18 yard box, players must kick the ball using their feet and are not permitted to use their hands.
