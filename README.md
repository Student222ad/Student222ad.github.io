## *Introduction to Football*

Football is a game in which two teams of eleven players attempt to move the ball into the goal of the other team by utilizing any part of their body other than their hands and arms. The goalie is the only one allowed to handle the ball, and even then, only in the penalty area that surrounds the goal. Whichever team scores the most goals wins.

Football is the most popular ball game in the world in terms of both participants and spectators. The sport, which has simple rules and equipment, may be played practically anyplace, from official football playing fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), football's governing body, estimated that at the turn of the twenty-first century, there were approximately 250 million football players and over 1.3 billion people "interested" in football; in 2010, a combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched football's premier tournament, the quadrennial month-long World Cup finals.
